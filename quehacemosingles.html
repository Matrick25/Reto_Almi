            <h2>Development of Functional Robots at Matrick</h2>
            <p>At Matrick, we have created 2 functional robots that walk and dance. Each team member has taken responsibility for a specific task to ensure the success of the project.</p>

            <h3>Team Members' Responsibilities</h3>
            <p>The roles of each team member were as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Juli√°n was responsible for ensuring the internet worked correctly.</li>
                <li>Unax developed the GitHub repository and participated in the assembly of the robots.</li>
                <li>Gontzal helped with the assembly of the robots and also designed a template for the website.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="parrafo">
            <h3>Project Planning and Execution</h3>
            <p>The process began with detailed planning of the work. Once we had the plan, we started by ensuring the internet was working properly. Then, we created the GitHub repository, assembled the robots, developed the website, and finally, wrote the Arduino code so the robots could function perfectly.</p>

        <div class="parrafo">
            <h3>Video Demonstration</h3>
            <p>At the end of the project, we recorded a video showing the entire process, accompanied by English subtitles to explain each step in detail.</p>
